# DSPy Utilities

::: danger Removed
The `backend_common.dspy_common` module has been **removed** from the `backend-common` package.
:::

All utilities previously documented here—including `AbstractDspyModule`, `DisableReasoningAdapter`, `SwissGermanStreamListener`, and `edit_distance_metric`—are no longer available. Please ensure your code does not depend on these components.
